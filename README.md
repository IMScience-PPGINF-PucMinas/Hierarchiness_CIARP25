# Hierarchiness_CIARP25

This is the demonstration code of the hierarchiness measures as proposed in: **F.Kochem, F.Belém, Z.K.G.Patrocínio Jr., B.Perret, J.Cousty, A.Falcão, S.Guimarães**. Detecting Hierarchical Inconsistencies from an Image Segmentation Series. To appear in the 28th Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition (CIARP), 2025. Please cite this work if you use it in your own project.

## Running

The project was developed in Python 3 under a Linux-based operational system; therefore, it is NOT GUARANTEED to work properly in other systems (e.g. Windows and macOS). One may run the demonstration program InconsHierarchical with the option -h or --help for outputting the possible parameters, as it is shown below:

```
python3 InconsHerarchical.py --help
```

Then, the program will indicate a brief description of all parameters for its proper execution.
